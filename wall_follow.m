%% SAMPLE PSUEDOCODE: WALL FOLLOWING
%(True distance-maintaining)
% Set up PID loop
	% Check for all black condition (made a complete circle)
	% Calculate error as the difference between the distance you intend to follow and the measured ultrasonic distance
	% Use prior values of error and/or motor setpoints/encoder rates to determine if the robot is reading a point in front of or behind it, and correct the control signal/motor setpoints accordingly to stabilize.

%OR

%(Hacky solution)
% Move forward while reading sensors
	% If reflectance is all black, exit loop
	% if the side ultrasonic reading exceeds a certain value
		% turn by a specified amount (or turn slowly, reading the ultrasonic until you read a new value greater than or equal to the current exceeded value), then proceed
